# PyTorchFI_SC

This is a modified version of [pytorchFI](https://github.com/pytorchfi/pytorchfi), This version implements GPU-aware fault injections in the feature maps of any DNN, as well as it includes support to perform single bit-flips injection on the binary representation of the weights of the DNN. 

More details about this particular implementation can be found in:
